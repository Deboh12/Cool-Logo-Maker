# Cool-Logo-Maker

## Description

Cool Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application designed for freelance web developers who want to generate simple logos for their projects without the need for a graphic designer. While building Cool Logo Maker, I gained experience in Node.js development, command-line interfaces, SVG file generation, and test-driven development using Jest. Additionally, I explored the use of Inquirer for collecting user input and honed my skills in organizing code into modular and testable components.

## Installation

To install Cool Logo Maker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Cool-Logo-Maker.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

## Usage

1. Run the application:

2. Follow the prompts to enter text, text color, choose a shape, and set the shape's color.


3. Once all prompts are complete, the application will generate an SVG file named logo.svg.


4. Copy and paste the SVG file into SVG Viewer and Editor.
